# city information

How it works:
    This program tells you some information about three cities.
    The information about the three cities are: country, population and one intresting fact.
    The three cities consists of Norway, USA and Australia.


How it's made:
    The program is made using nesting of dictonarys and for loops,
    so you can easily change out the information in the dictonary or add new cities.


Some general info:
    I am very new to programming so this is my first repository ever.
    I made this repository to get to know github a bit better.
